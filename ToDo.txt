RESEARCH HOW ENGINE DOES DAMAGE

Can I read which key was pressed to toggle an input event?
 - Would be better than having many events


1. Seriously Consider removing custom collision channels. No point
2. Fix slight offset on HUD crosshairs
3. UCard::SpawnedActorCallback on Card_TEST isn't always applying damage despite always being called


Fix weapon bug that has them facing the wrong direction if they're facing the wrong direcion in the world

Understand projectile construction helpers and how to implement them

Properly Set Collision in C++ on character and weapon

Understand the different ways to bind methods

Figure out how to have the GameDamageStruct by a child of the engine damage struct







-- Possible bugs --
APlayerCharacter::EquipWeapon has collision for both weapons active simultaneously.
This might be a problem if weapons ever need to collide with one another





-- Card Ideas --
 A card that uses the top card in your discard pile
 
 A card that spawns an allied turret
