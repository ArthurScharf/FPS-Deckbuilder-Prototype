RESEARCH HOW ENGINE DOES DAMAGE


Why does recompiling code confuse it?


Understand projectile construction helpers and how to implement them

Properly Set Collision in C++ on character and weapon

Understand the different ways to bind methods




Figure out how to have the GameDamageStruct by a child of the engine damage struct

Figure out how to create seperate header files for the GameDamageStruct and redefinitions of GameTraceChannels

C++ player controller ONLY DO IF YOU NEED TO WRITE C++ CONTROLLER
 - Player controller should be attached to it's pawn






-- Possible bugs --
APlayerCharacter::EquipWeapon has collision for both weapons active simultaneously.
This might be a problem if weapons ever need to collide with one another
