RESEARCH HOW ENGINE DOES DAMAGE


Why does recompiling code confuse it?


Fix weapon bug that has them facing the wrong direction if they're facing the wrong direcion in the world


Understand projectile construction helpers and how to implement them

Properly Set Collision in C++ on character and weapon

Understand the different ways to bind methods


IMPORTANT: Don't use meta = ("AllowPrivateAccess"). Use methods instead



Figure out how to have the GameDamageStruct by a child of the engine damage struct

Figure out how to create seperate header files for the GameDamageStruct and redefinitions of GameTraceChannels

C++ player controller ONLY DO IF YOU NEED TO WRITE C++ CONTROLLER
 - Player controller should be attached to it's pawn






-- Possible bugs --
APlayerCharacter::EquipWeapon has collision for both weapons active simultaneously.
This might be a problem if weapons ever need to collide with one another
