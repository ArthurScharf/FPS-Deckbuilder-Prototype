RESEARCH HOW ENGINE DOES DAMAGE

Can I read which key was pressed to toggle an input event?
 - Would be better than having many events


1. Seriously Consider removing custom collision channels. No point
2. Fix slight offset on HUD crosshairs
3. UCard::SpawnedActorCallback on Card_TEST isn't always applying damage despite always being called


Fix weapon bug that has them facing the wrong direction if they're facing the wrong direcion in the world

Understand projectile construction helpers and how to implement them

Properly Set Collision in C++ on character and weapon

Understand the different ways to bind methods

Figure out how to have the GameDamageStruct by a child of the engine damage struct








// -- Enemy Attack notification Design -- // 

Behavior tree task get's the enemies AttackCompleteDelegate and binds the FinishExecute method to it. it then calls that enemies attack method.
The attack method runs the animation.
the animation notifies the skeleton which in turn notifies the enemy which it is bound to.
the attack completes and the animation is free to continue to work as it peleases


BehaviorTree 
 Attack Node
  Binds "Finish Execute" to EnemyAnimInstance's "OnAttackAnimationCompleteDelegate" then starts the Enemy's attack animation through the appropriate attack method
  Attack animation triggers AttackAnimationComplete notify on the skeleton
  AnimInstance blueprint receives notification and calls Broadcasts "OnAttackAnimationCompleteDelegate"
  Behavior tree node receives FinishExecute and continues process


Each AnimInstance blueprint + skeleton must implement their own AttackDamageEvent[n]'s
Each AnimInstance must use it's "BlueprintInitializeAnimation" to set the C++ variable "EnemyCharacter" to the owner pawn of animation. I'd like to be done in C++, since it's repeated with each blueprint instance of EnemyAnimInstance
  







-- Possible bugs --
APlayerCharacter::EquipWeapon has collision for both weapons active simultaneously.
This might be a problem if weapons ever need to collide with one another





-- Card Ideas --
 A card that uses the top card in your discard pile
 
 A card that spawns an allied turret

 A card that makes you puke something up. Maybe a nasty energy drink?

 Shit or get off the pot
  : doesn't summon allie or summons better ally

 Break times over
  : spawns a few weaker enemies

 Red rez or heal is crystal defibrelator
